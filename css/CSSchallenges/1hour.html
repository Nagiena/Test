  <h1>Rapunzel....</h1>
  <p class="style1">Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named Rapunzel who had long, golden hair that shimmered like sunlight. She was taken from her parents as a baby by an evil witch and locked away in a tall tower deep in the forest. The tower had no doors or stairs, and the only way in or out was for Rapunzel to let down her long hair when the witch called, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!"....
  <br>Rapunzel spent her days singing and dreaming of the outside world, never knowing what lay beyond the tower walls. One day, a handsome prince heard her singing and followed her voice through the forest. He watched as the witch climbed up using Rapunzel’s hair and, after the witch left, he called out the same words. Rapunzel let down her hair, and the prince climbed up to meet her.....
  They quickly fell in love, but when the witch found out, she grew furious and cut off Rapunzel’s hair, banishing her to a faraway land. The prince, blinded by the witch’s curse, wandered in search of his love.<br> After many hardships, he finally found Rapunzel, and her tears of joy healed his blindness. Together, they returned to his kingdom, where they lived happily ever after, free from the witch’s grasp.</p>
